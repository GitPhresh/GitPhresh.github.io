		A multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the
		Ancients,
		a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre.
		Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character
		customization.
		The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
