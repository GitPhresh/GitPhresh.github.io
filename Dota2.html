			A 2013 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the
			Ancients (DotA),
			a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in
			matches between two
			teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map.
			Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character known as a "hero" that all have unique
			abilities and differing styles of play.
			During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the
			opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other
			team's "Ancient",
			a large structure located within their base.
